Yesterday (Friday), I went with the baptist collegiate ministry on a
rafting trip. We were 9 persons in total from Georgia Tech. This seemed
to be an annual event and baptist organizations all around Georgia was
partaking. We were all very well accommodated with free snacks and
fruits on Friday evening. I also met students from other Georgia
colleges at the motel. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures of
anything so far.

Next morning, after some good ol' southern [grits] for breakfast, we
finally went rafting! You cannot bring your camera on the rafting trip
unless it's water proof, but instead I took some photos after I went
rafting, hopefully they'll lighten up this post a bit!

All in all I was very happy to partake in this trip, I met a lot of new
people and shared some thoughts. For instance, I was surprised to hear
from even more Americans that they fully supported open gun laws.  Oh
by the way, in North Carolina you can buy firearms at walmart, even during
midnight. That's correct, their pharmacy section is only open during day time,
but their gun shop is open 24/7.

Tomorrow morning I'm going rafting again, but this time with the office
of international education, only exchange students. So I guess there
will be mostly Europeans present, but I'll write about that tomorrow. So
today I were at Murphy, NC and tomorrow I'm heading for Ocoee,
Tennessee. This second time will be with a totally different group as
I've said.

Finally here are the pictures!
