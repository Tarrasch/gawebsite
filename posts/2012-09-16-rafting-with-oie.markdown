Yep, I rafted today too, this time with OIE[^1]! Somewhat to my surprise, it did not feel boring
because I already had done it the day before. The feel for this time was
quite different. First of all we had an excellent guide with us this
time and everything felt more organized. With a guide, we could actually
focus on getting wet and having fun without having to be on the constant
look for rocks we could get stuck on. The guide also did his job with a
passion, telling all the old folklores of each rock we pass by and their
names. But the day before had it's charm as well. For example, it was
really funny when a guy fell into the water and we had to rescue him,
another challenge that would not happen if we had a real guide was that
we got stuck on a rock for several minutes. This meant that good
teamwork was required to get us unstuck!

This time my raft group decided to put our money together and pay for
the instant photographs, they came on a CD and I've uploaded some of
them to this blog.  I also took some pictures with my own digital camera
before I went rafting.
