Two days ago I went rafting in the middle of Atlanta...

Erm no, there really is no place to raft in the middle of Atlanta of
course, however, what I wanted to tell you were that it was *raining
like hell* and I had to bike from one of the dining halls to my
classroom. I got extremely wet that day, way more than I did during the
rafting trips!

Anyway, what I really wanted to tell you were that I bought a new bike
some weeks ago, I got it for about $200 dollars with a lock and helmet
included. So far I've mostly been on campus. I never go anywhere outside
of campus except for when I'm on a trip with a group or when I'm going
for groceries. It should however be noted that I think tech's campus is
quite big in comparison to what I've seen in Sweden.  You definitely
need a car if you want to go outside of campus, so I
only use the bike on campus, but the bike allows me to quickly go from
one side of the campus to the other in like 10 minutes!

Does this benefit me? Well, for the last two weeks, I've spent my
Tuesday and Thursday mornings going to the recreation center (the gym),
since I go with my bike, I don't even need to bring clothes since I just
bike home again and shower. Also, I spend most of my time playing squash
at the recreation center, which back in Sweden meant that I had to curry
tons of stuff, like a racket, a ball, maybe a towel etc.  But here, they
provide all that free of charge! Today I actually played squash with a
guy from Latvia named Kaspers. So yea, since I never have classes in the
morning on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I can easily schedule in some well
needed recreation hours every week. Furthermore, the recreation center
is quite close because I have a bike and I don't need to bring my own
equipment.

Usually after I'm done at the recreation center, I go to one of the
*dining halls*. The dining halls at Georgia Tech are restaurants where
everything is all you can eat, and the there are multiple kinds of food.
They have one dish that varies from day to day but they also have a
bunch of stuff that is always there, that includes hamburgers, pizza,
salad. What I really like is that it is a buffet and since I go here
after work out I can eat for two people and pay for one.  Thus, getting
one free meal! :)

So all in all, I'm really liking to have a bike and it makes my life
easier, since both the recreation center and the dining halls would have
been to far away without a bike, even if everything is on campus.
