Today was pretty much a regular day for me, yet I managed to take some
pictures so I thought this day is blog post worthy.

The first thing I saw when going to school today was that the [Student
Alumni Association][saa] was having their kick-off day for
registrations, which means that interested students can join starting
from this day. Anyhow, this meant that they were all over the campus
today with their tents and lots of personnel handing out candy and stuff
-- given that you say the secret word! I had no idea what word they were
looking for, after a bunch of random guesses one of them hinted me,
"look at the sign", I saw the text "THWG". Unbelievably enough I
actually managed to guess what the abbreviation stands for, on a single
try! Can you too? For managing to figure out the secret word I was
rewarded a chocolate cane

Anyhow, whilst there I took a picture together with buzz! While at it, I
also upload a picture of the candy I got.

As for eating while I live here, I prefer free food and I try hard to
optimize for that criteria! Both today and the day before, I actually
got both my lunch and my dinner free! Today a student organization for
acoustics where having there startup meeting, while I'm not interested
in acoustics, I wanted to see how the attendance is at a typical student
organization for ME students, also, I wanted the free food. What I
observed at their meeting was that *nobody in ME cares about their
subject*, no undergraduate student was attending at all! While I've been
to all other CS organization intros, there have *always* been like 200
attendees, more than the room actually fits, and most of them were
undergrads, many of which were freshmen. The acoustics meeting had less
than 30 attendants. Oh, and by the way, they served pizza from Papa
John's.

At 6 pm I went to see the programming contest group at Georgia Tech, and
boy were there many participants, like almost 50. They also served free
pizza, so I decided to hit a hamburger from another meeting and then
run. A healthy diet is a diverse diet, we all know that! Oh, and I took
a picture of the burger as well!

Today they also had this evening activity that my student housing
arranged, these events are quite rare and the first I'm aware of. It was
a gaming night with all kinds of games, ping pong, guitar hero, settlers
of catan and more. I sat down and took a picture with the mahjong
players.
